# PyCharm 2018.2 Out Now

PyCharm 2018.2 is now available:Pipenv enviroments, pytest support improvements, new and improved quick documentation, and much more

## New in Pycharm
・Pycharm now fully supperts pipenv: easily create projects with pipenv, create a pipfile, and have PyCarhm update it for you
 when you install packages. If you're checking out a ptoject from GitHub with a pipfile, a pipenv will be created automatically, and you can install all dependencies with one click.

・Support for oytest has been improved in PyCharm 2018.2:code completion and inspections are now support for pytest fixtures.
 If you'd like like to use BDD, pytest-bdd is now supported as well. 
 Please note that BDD support is available only in PyCharm  Professional Edition.

・Quick documentation has been redesigned to be easier to use and also just to look better. 
　　Don’t have docs yet? The reStructuredText editor now comes with a preview window, making editing rst files a lot easier.
  
Further code insight, version control, and other improvements have been made, read the What’s New page to learn more. Already convinced? Then download PyCharm now
