Interfaces in Java
Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables, but the methods declared in interface are bu default abstract(only method signature, no body).

 -Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how. It is the blueprint of the class.
 -An Interface is about capabilities like a Player may be an interface and any class implementing Player must be able to (or must implement) move(). So itspecifies a set of methods that the class has to implements.
 -If a class implements an interface and does not provide method bodies for all functions specified in the interface, then class nust be declared abstract.
 -A Java library example is, Comparator Interface. If a class implements this interface, then it can be userd to sort a collection.
