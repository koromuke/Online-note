Anglar? Vue? React? What JS frontend do you use with your PHP backend?

For example, how wwll does your JS "mingle" with your server-side?(e.g. is it compatible with your templaing system? 
Is it somehow manageable fromm your controller?)
I'm pretty happy with the state of my PHP setup but the fromt-end(JS) portion of my projects are always lacking.
I've messed around with a few different JS frameweoks but haven't been able to confidently pick one yet.

We use vue and I love it. Its super clean, dead somple and isnt overly bloaterd.
I love angular. It had a bi of learning curve, but I'm really feeling it now. It's an added bonus that ionic (cordova)exists witch is basically angular make moble apps.
I know other options as well. this just works well for me.

Why React is better than Vue.js and When
Let me start this story from the point i the past.
In the time someone of you was not even born yet.
In the pre-HTMl and pre-Windows(manager)era-MS DOS(or modern linux :P)

For me the first real library to build the first real user interfaces, was TurboVision be Borland. And it was AGES ago.
And it was easy to build something much more complex, than modern SPA usually can afford.

It grows up and becomes Delphi. And Delphi changed the world. You was able to design how your application will look like using  a mouse!
Add few events, handlers and... work is done!

And everthing was a Delphi Component,you can drag-n-drop to your Form.
Even Timer, Socket or Database.

It a same time there was another approavh to do everything---MFC---Microsoft Foundation Class Library.

It wa absolutoly different approach do... everything.
Much more harder and much more low level --jus a C++.

But there real difference between this two approaches was different -- De;phi was a designer tool, and MFC was a library.
They were build having different idras in mind.

To be honest- it was super easy to do something in Delphi, as result was always looking the same-- it was not easy to modify concreted Delphi forms,
but native to do it with MFC, so Application build using MFC was looking better.

Vue is like Smarty, jade or Anguar -- they are inventing their own template language. Always limited language, even if it better fits for your needs
